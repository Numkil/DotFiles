DotFiles
=======

Content inside DotFiles:

* MPV config
* Bashrc
* Personal extra vim configurations

My base .VIMRC is not included in this package because you can find it at this url:

    https://github.com/Numkil/VimConf


TODO
----
* Keep up to date with new stuff I find.
* Increase this package with more stuff I configured when applicable.
